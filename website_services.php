    <span>What Are NFTs?</span>
    <p>Let’s start with the basics. The term NFT stands for “Non-Fungible Token.”

        Put simply, it is a unique digital record, stored on the blockchain (predominantly Ethereum), that provides
        proof of ownership of a specific digital asset. This could include ownership of anything like a jpg, a video, an
        audio file, or really any other type of digital file.

        Some popular examples include the NBA, which sells NFTs of video clips of basketball games. Or digital artist
        Beeple who famously sold his art for $69 million in an auction.</p>
    <span> 1. As an investment</span>
    <p>The scarcity aspect of NFTs has led them to become collectibles, and historically their value increases after the
        initial sale. Similarly to buying a piece of art as an investment, people hope and expect the value of their NFT
        to increase.</p>

    <span>2. For a certain utility or access</span>
    <p>For example, some NFTs are sold as part of a collection with exclusive access to a community. By buying an NFT
        from the collection, you get access to the community. NFTs could also provide access to real-world events and
        items. One example I have to share because they’re one of my favorite bands is Kings of Leon, who released their
        album last year as an NFT. Anyone who purchased it gained access to special perks, such as limited-edition vinyl
        or future concert tickets.</p>

    <span>3. People genuinely value the art</span>
    <p>Some people simply value quality artwork that stands out to them. If you buy NFT art, you now own a piece of art
        and can even display it in real life via digital screens.</p>
