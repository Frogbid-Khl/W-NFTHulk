    <span>Why Should You Join an NFT Discord Community?</span>
    <p>NFT communities are great places to get information about the next potential NFT projects and gain exposure to
        early news about the NFT world faster than any other social media platform. Here are some of the reasons why you
        should join an NFT discord community.</p>
    <span>1. NFT Collectors</span>
    <p>Every NFT collector should join a discord community for timely updates on big NFT projects with the highest
        potential. It’s worth investing time in various NFT discord communities if you’re looking for the next biggest
        NFT projects.</p>
    <span>2. NFT Investor</span>
    <p>Joining an active NFT project discord server would help investors determine the potential for success of the NFT
        projects. The more active the community is, the higher the likelihood of the project blowing in the future. This
        would help you make wise investment decisions.</p>
    <span>3. NFT Artist</span>
    <p>There are some NFT artist discord communities specifically for NFT artists. This platform is a great way for you
        to get to meet other NFT artists and be inspired by them. The feeling of the community would also ensure you
        don’t feel left alone in the chaotic world on NFT.</p>
    <span>4. NFT Beginner/Newbie</span>
    <p>As a learner/beginner just testing the waters on NFT, the first thing you should do is find the right NFT Discord
        community to join. This would help you gain knowledge about the NFT world from people who’ve already been there
        longer than you have.</p>
