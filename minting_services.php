    <h2>NFT Minting</h2>
    <span>What Is Minting NFT?</span>
    <p>An NFT is a blockchain-based token that proves ownership of a digital item such as images, video files, and even
        physical assets. In simple terms, Minting an NFT refers to converting digital files into crypto collections or
        digital assets stored on the blockchain.
        <br>
        The digital items or files will be stored in a decentralized database or distributed ledger and cannot be
        edited, modified, or deleted. Similar to fiat currency creation, when a manufacturer mints a physical coin, the
        process of uploading a specific item to the blockchain is known as minting.
        <br>
        During the printing process, the creators of the NFTs can schedule royalties from each next sale, which will
        become a commission they can receive each time their work is sold to someone else or traded on the secondary
        market.<br>

    <span>Where You Can Mint?</span>
    <p>You can mint NFTs in different marketplaces like Opensea or we can implement your own minting mechanism in your
        website. User can mint your nft collection from you website and also directly publish it on Opensea.
